To use locally, you can run it by cloning the repo, and running

```npm install``` for dependencies.

After this, you can run 

```node server.js```

which will use the default port ```3000```, or you can define a custom port number by providing it as the first argument.

For example, to use port ```1337```, you'd use

```node server.js 1337```.
